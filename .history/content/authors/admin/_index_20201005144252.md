I am a third-year PhD student in School of Engineering at National University of Singapore, supervised by the Professor [Andrew Lim](https://www.limandrew.org). I have published over twenty papers in the refereed journals and conferences, such as TKDE, KDD, NeurIPS, IJCAI, AAAI and UbiComp. Thanks to the supervision of Prof. Yu Zheng and Dr. Junbo Zhang, I started my research career at MSRA and graduated from Xidian University.

My research interests lie in graph neural networks, 3d point cloud and spatio-temporal data mining. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!
